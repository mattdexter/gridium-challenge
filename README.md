# Gridium Interview Challenge Entry

Thanks for taking a look at my work! My entry is a Flask app in Python 3.

To set up and run:
- Clone and cd into the repository
- Run pip3 install -r requirements.txt
- Source the .env file
- Run python3 app.py

An instance of Flask will run on your localhost. Simply open a browser and navigate to:

- 0.0.0.0:5000

And you will see the desired output. Please let me know if you have any questions!
